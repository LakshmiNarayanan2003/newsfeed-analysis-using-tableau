# newsfeed-analysis-using-tableau
An analysis done on the real-time dataset of 365datascience to gain insights such as percentage of visitors to the newsfeed actively interacted with the feature, which post subtype is the least favored, etc..


## Objective

In this project, we’ll tackle a real-world case optimizing a website’s newsfeed feature for maximum user engagement. The main goal is to generate graphs that analyze users’ interaction patterns with the 365 platform’s Newsfeed service and to determine which type resonates more with the audience and identify potential issues with these features, along with suggestions for enhancements. The task is to create several visualizations giving crucial information about the newsfeed and how the users react to it.

**The challenge:** A newsfeed is a part of a website that constantly updates with new content, showing the latest news or activities. This feature facilitates real-time discoveries and encourages user engagement by presenting fresh content each time the user accesses the platform. The 365 platform’s Newsfeed offers a mix of automated and manual posts. Automated entries showcase students’ milestones, such as completing an award card collection or earning a certificate of achievement. On the other hand, manual entries are texts created by students to share insights or opinions with the community.

## Conclusion with answers to these questions
- **Regarding average likes per post, which post subtype is the least favored?**

  The **Career Track Certificate** subtype is least favored. The reasons could be:
  1. These are less career track certificate posts because it takes a lot of time to attain them.
  2. Users did not just like those types of posts.
 
- **In absolute terms, which types of posts are most common, and which are the rarest on the newsfeed?**

  The most common type of posts are **Level Posts**. The rarest is the **Career Track Certificate**.
  
- **What percentage of visitors to the newsfeed actively interacted with the feature?**

  1. On average, 76% of users have interacted with the **Like Feature**.
  2. On average, 38% of users have interacted with the **Comment Feature**.
    
- **Given your observations, what recommendations can you offer to enhance user interaction with the newsfeed? (Consider acting on subtypes that frequently appear even though they don't particularly captivate the users.)**
  With the dashboard, we can see that almost half of people who like do not comment on the newsfeed/post. In order to increase it, once the user likes the post, we can redirect them to the comment section with the pre-defined "Congrats", "Kudos". This might increase the user interaction within the newsfeed.

I have attached the Tableau file (newsfeed_analysis.twbx) that contains all the visualizations.
